# Controlled-Comparison-of-Government-Regime-Types

In low GDP-countries, there isn't much of a correlation between democracies and ethnicity; the results showed that nearly 50% of countries were a democracy at low, medium and high diversity. In high GDP-countries, there is a correlation between democracies and ethnicity; the results showed that the more diverse the country the more likely it is to be a democracy. After controlling for economic development, the relationship between ethnic diversity and government regime is an interaction relationship because the relation of the democracy to ethnic diversity depends on the value of the control variable which is GDP (being high or low).
